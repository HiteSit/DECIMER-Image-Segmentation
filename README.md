# DECIMER-Image-Segmentation
Image segmentation initial works by Kohulan Rajan and Otto Brinkhaus

Using Mask R-CNN we are trying to segment the chemical structures from publiahed literatures. The mask R-CNN's superior algorithm can easlity segment an Image upon training it widly with a mixed set of Data, Includes the Images of published literature with text and correspondong manually annotated data regarding the position of the images.

Initial work was done using training the Mask R-CNN network with our own dat and deploying on completely new set of data to see the segmantation accuracy. Later we are working on a cleaning up procedure on the segmented Images to fit to the Image detection algorithm.
